# Decision-Trees


This document serves as a guide and overview for the Jupyter notebook "Assignment3_Work Jiahe Shi," a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) project. This notebook is structured to provide a step-by-step walkthrough of data analysis techniques, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, aiming to deliver insights into a specific dataset and predict outcomes with ML models.


The notebook is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a different stage of the data analysis and ML pipeline. It begins with an introduction that outlines the project's objectives, the dataset in focus, and the key questions to be addressed. Following this, the notebook is organized into distinct segments:


Data Import and Cleaning: This section deals with loading the dataset, handling missing values, and making the data suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Here, the focus is on understanding the dataset's characteristics through visualization and statistics. It includes generating plots for distribution of variables, correlations between features, and other insights that could inform the subsequent modeling process.

Feature Engineering: This part involves creating new features from existing data and selecting the most relevant features for modeling. Techniques such as one-hot encoding, scaling, and transformation are applied to prepare the dataset for machine learning algorithms.

Model Selection and Training: Various machine learning models are explored and evaluated in this section. It covers the splitting of data into training and testing sets, applying different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests), and tuning model parameters for optimal performance.

Evaluation and Conclusion: The final section discusses the performance of the models, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Conclusions are drawn based on the analysis, and recommendations are made for future work or applications of the findings.
